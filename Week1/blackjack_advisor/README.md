BLACKJACK ADVISOR
The blackjack_advisor program you tell you what your optimal move is for the
card game blackjack based on the information you provide. You will prompted
to enter the value of your first card, second card, and the dealer's card. For
cards 2 - 10, just enter the number value that corresponds with the card.
You can enter the value 11 or "A" for the ace. An ace will always have the
value 11. You can enter the value 10 or "K","Q", "J" for face cards. If you
choose to enter a letter instead of a number, it MUST be CAPITALIZED. After
you enter the dealer's card value, the program will give you one of 5 responses:
"Hit", "Split", "Stay", "Double if possible, otherwise stay", and "Double if
possible, otherwise hit."
